# Two and Three Gamma Positron Annihilation Imaging Using a Gamma Ray Tracking Detector
## Nicolas Dronchi - dronchin@msu.edu

This project is the imaging work done on two- and three-gamma events recorded by the GRETINA array. The GRETINA detector assembly, 
a high purity germanium gamma-ray tracking array, is a state-of-the-art device for performing coincident gamma-ray measurements in 
nuclear structure experiments. During a GRETINA campaign at Michigan State University, the characteristics of nuclear imaging with 
GRETINA were investigated by tracking photons from both two- and three- photon positronium-annihilation events originating from 
sodium-22 sources and a fluorine-18 phantoms. This repository holds the work done in investigating the imaging properties of this.

## Data

The data sets used to produce images are not included in the repositroy. Please reach out to me at dronchin@msu.edu with regards to obtaining
any of the data required to reproduce results.

## Requirements

This project primarly requires python 3 with dependencies on the numpy and matplotlib.pyplot libraries.
A few files under "Two-Gamma Imaging>3Dimensions attempt" have dependencies on the pyqtgraph library.
